# KevinBaconCalculator

Kevin Bacon Calculator is a project I took on starting in the HarvardX course cs50 ai

The Goal of this Project is two link two actors based on association
every association or degree of seperation is two actors who have stared in the same move
This comes from the online notion that every actor in hollyword is connected to kevin bacon by six degrees or less

Originally this was made to the specifications of cs50 ai, but has later been greatly improved to reduce the calculation time.
